    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "You are a data scientist working on a classification problem to predict whether a hotel reservation will be canceled or not. You have been provided with a dataset named **`\"hotel_reservations.csv\"`**, which includes various attributes related to hotel bookings. The dataset comprises the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `booking_id:` unique identifier of each booking\n",
    "- `no_of_adults:` Number of adults\n",
    "- `no_of_children:` Number of Children\n",
    "- `no_of_weekend_nights:` Number of weekend nights (Saturday or Sunday) the guest stayed or booked to stay at the hotel\n",
    "- `no_of_week_nights:` Number of week nights (Monday to Friday) the guest stayed or booked to stay at the hotel\n",
    "- `type_of_meal_plan:` Type of meal plan booked by the customer\n",
    "- `required_car_parking_space:` Does the customer require a car parking space? (0 - No, 1- Yes)\n",
    "- `room_type_reserved:` Type of room reserved by the customer. The values are ciphered (encoded) by INN Hotels\n",
    "- `lead_time:` Number of days between the date of booking and the arrival date\n",
    "- `arrival_year:` Year of arrival date\n",
    "- `arrival_month:` Month of arrival date\n",
    "- `arrival_date:` Date of the month\n",
    "- `market_segment_type:` Market segment designation\n",
    "- `repeated_guest:` Is the customer a repeated guest? (0 - No, 1- Yes)\n",
    "- `no_of_previous_cancellations:` Number of previous bookings that were canceled by the customer prior to the current booking\n",
    "- `no_of_previous_bookings_not_canceled:` Number of previous bookings not canceled by the customer prior to the current booking\n",
    "- `avg_price_per_room:` Average price per day of the reservation; prices of the rooms are dynamic (in euros)\n",
    "- `no_of_special_requests:` Total number of special requests made by the customer (e.g. high floor, view from the room, etc)\n",
    "- `booking_status:` Flag indicating if the booking was canceled or not (Not_Canceled = 0, Canceled = 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You will perform data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model training using different algorithms, including logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and Naive Bayes. Additionally, you will implement k-fold cross-validation, stratified k-fold cross-validation, grid search, and randomized search techniques.\n",
