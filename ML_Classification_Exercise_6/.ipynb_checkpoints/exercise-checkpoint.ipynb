    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "You are a data scientist / AI engineer working on a breast cancer recurrence prediction project. You have been provided with a dataset named **`\"breast_cancer_data.csv\"`**, which includes various clinical and pathological factors influencing the recurrence of breast cancer. The dataset comprises the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `age:` Age of the patient (ranges: 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69).\n",
    "- `menopause:` Menopause status of the patient (premeno, ge40, lt40).\n",
    "- `tumor-size:` Size of the tumor (ranges in mm).\n",
    "- `inv-nodes:` Number of involved lymph nodes (ranges).\n",
    "- `node-caps:` Whether node caps are present (yes or no).\n",
    "- `deg-malig:` Degree of malignancy (1, 2, 3).\n",
    "- `breast:` Breast involved (left or right).\n",
    "- `breast-quad:` Quadrant of the breast involved (left_up, left_low, right_up, right_low, central).\n",
    "- `irradiat:` Whether the patient received irradiation (yes or no).\n",
    "- `class:` Recurrence of breast cancer (no-recurrence-events, recurrence-events).\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to analyze this dataset to understand the factors contributing to breast cancer recurrence. You will handle class imbalance using various techniques and build machine learning models to predict whether a patient will experience recurrence events based on the provided features."
